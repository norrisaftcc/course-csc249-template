I'll analyze your materials and create a comprehensive course development package. Let me start by examining the uploaded files to understand your current state.Perfect! I can see your current state clearly. Let me create a comprehensive course development package that bridges your Zybooks usage (this final semester) with your Runestone integration (building for future), while maintaining your distinctive "create before theory" pedagogy.

I'll create 5 key documents:I've created a comprehensive course development package for CSC 249. Here are your 5 documents:

## **What I've Built**

### 1. **Course Outline** (Complete Semester View)
- Full 16-week structure with philosophy statement
- Resource ecosystem (Zybooks, Runestone, VisuAlgo)
- Assessment structure and grade breakdown
- Establishes "create before theory" as course DNA

### 2. **Module Breakdown** (Implementation Detail)
- **Heavy detail on M01-M04** (your immediate development need)
- Day-by-day lesson plans for first 8 weeks
- Lighter outlines for M05-M08 (to be refined with feedback)
- Clear "TO DEVELOP" checklists for each module

### 3. **Instructor Mindset Guide** (Your Teaching Philosophy)
- Operationalizes the "create first" pedagogy
- Month-by-month teaching tactics and resistance handling
- The "Rippetoe Principle" applied to data structures
- Assessment philosophy: "What we're REALLY grading"
- Emergency procedures for struggling students

### 4. **Zybooks Transition Strategy** (Light Use → Obsolete)
- Chapter-by-chapter guidance: when to assign, when to skip
- Usage levels: High/Medium/Low/None dependency per module
- Development priorities for summer (M05-M06 gaps)
- Extinction timeline through Fall 2027

### 5. **AI Collaboration Framework** (Mandatory, Not Optional)
- Three tiers: AI as Reference → Pair Programmer → Learning Accelerator
- The `prompts.txt` system with template
- Assessment instruments throughout semester
- Guardrails preventing AI dependency

## **How to Use These Documents**

**Right Now (Course Prep)**:
1. Read **Instructor Mindset Guide** first (establishes your teaching stance)
2. Review **Module Breakdown** M01-M04 (your immediate 8 weeks)
3. Skim **Course Outline** for big picture

**Week 1**:
- Use **AI Collaboration Framework** to set up `prompts.txt` system
- Reference **Zybooks Transition Strategy** for what to assign (minimal!)
- Follow **Module Breakdown** Day 1-6 plans

**Throughout Semester**:
- **Module Breakdown**: Your daily teaching guide
- **Zybooks Strategy**: Quick reference ("Should I assign this section?")
- **Mindset Guide**: Reread when you feel yourself slipping into lecture mode
- **AI Framework**: Reference for grading prompts.txt and handling concerns

**Summer 2026**:
- **Zybooks Strategy** Appendix shows development priorities
- Build M05-M06 materials based on what students actually used this semester

## **Key Insights from Your Materials**

I noticed you have:
- Strong M5LAB_A pedagogy from CSC 134 (game-based, scaffolded)
- M04 materials already developed (stacks tutorial, rubric)
- Runestone mapping showing where it's strong vs. weak
- Dual-language philosophy (C++ and Python choice)

**So I designed**:
- M01-M04 as fully specified (you can start teaching Monday)
- M05-M08 as structural outlines (iterate with feedback)
- Heavy integration of your existing M04 materials
- AI collaboration as the missing piece (mandatory, documented)

## **Next Steps**

1. **This Week**: Review documents, make any tweaks
2. **Before Week 1**: Set up GitHub repo structure, create first labs
3. **Week 1**: Launch with AI bootcamp and GitHub workflow
4. **After M02**: Assess if "create first" is working (pivot if needed)
5. **Summer**: Develop M05-M06 based on semester data

The documents are designed to **evolve**—treat M01-M04 as "set" and M05-M08 as flexible. Your course will improve iteratively, just like you're teaching students to code iteratively.
